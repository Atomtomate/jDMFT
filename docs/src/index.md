# jDMFT.jl Documentation

Small demonstration of a Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) solver with some examples of impurity solvers included.
For now there is a IteratedPerturbation Theory (IPT) and continuous time quantum Monte Carlo, interaction expansion (CT-INT), solver available.


TODO: at some point I should provide some actual documentation here.
